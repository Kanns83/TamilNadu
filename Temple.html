    This is a list of temples in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which is famed for Tamil architecture styled Hindu temples, culture, and tradition and commonly known as the Land of Temples.[1] Tamil Nadu has more temples than any other states of India. Tamil Nadu is home to more than 400,000 Hindu temples and is aptly called "the land of temples" by the media. Many are at least 800 years old and are found scattered all over the state. The rulers of various dynasties constructed these temples over centuries. Vimanas (storeys) and Gopuram (towering gateways to the temple complex) best characterize the temples of Tamil Nadu.[1]
